-PROJECT OVERVIEW-
* For this project, using plain JavaScript, I used "pagination" to enhance a web page's usability.
* I begin by using my JavaScript skills to display the first nine students on the page.
* Then I added pagination buttons that the user can click to display different pages of students.
* I then created a program that works with a list of any number of students.
